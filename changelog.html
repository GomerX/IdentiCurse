<h2>0.9: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>"from ostatus" is now replaced by "from $INSTANCE_URL" for remote notices.</li>
<li>Thanks to <a href="http://identi.ca/moggers87">@moggers87</a>, we now have mostly functional UTF text entry support (i.e., non-ASCII characters work properly) - true support would depend on Python 2.x actually getting a curses module with proper wide-char support.</li>
<li>Slogans now appear instead of the "doing nothing" message. Can be restored to old behaviour by setting "status_slogans" to false in config.</li>
<li>Tabs are now numbered - for tabs 1-9, the number is the same one you press to switch straight to it. Can be disabled by setting "enumerate_tabs" to false in config.</li>
<li>Border is now off by default. However, if you already set "border" in config, it will remain how you set it.</li>
<li>New slogans, as usual.</li>
<li>Bugfixes for:
    <ul>
        <li>Non-sane application of "new_reply_mode" when splitting notices.</li>
        <li>All the "NoneType has no length" errors so far unearthed.</li>
        <li>Crashes on "/user (n)"-type commands, where (n) is a notice number.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_8_2">
<h2>0.8.2: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed broken setup_py2exe.py.</li>
<li>Fixed broken OAuth code.</li>
</ul>

<li>Fixed broken setup.py.</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_8">
<h2>0.8: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>New slogans.</li>
<li>Pausing (p to toggle pause on the current tab, P for all tabs), with a pause line to indicate which notices are before/after a pause.</li>
<li>Unfavouriting notices (command /unfavourite, or hotkey F).</li>
<li>Z (shift+z) keybinding to move to last dent in timeline.</li>
<li>Config is now stored in ~/.identicurse/config.json. Any existing setups will be automatically converted upon start.</li>
<li>Colourschemes can now be stored as discrete files, and pulled in with the "colorscheme" config key. Sample colourscheme provided under misc/.</li>
<li>Default keybindings can now be fully overriden.</li>
<li>d/D default bindings are now reply mode/reply respectively, the opposite way round to in 0.7, since reply mode is generally more useful.</li>
<li>L (shift+l) keybinding to display notice links, for use in (for example) linking others to a specific dent.</li>
<li>Support for Status.net 1.0's conversation API, allowing full conversations to be viewed at last. (only on 1.0+ instances)</li>
<li>Support for displaying "user -> user"-style addressee information on 1.0+ instances.</li>
<li>Moved to using Leah Culver's python-oauth module (MIT licensed), resolves some weird OAuth edgecase bugs.</li>
<li>&lt;TAB&gt;/+ and &lt;shift+TAB&gt;/- bindings for cycling through tabs (second pair cycles backwards).</li>
<li>New regex-based filtering mode. More complex, but more flexible.</li>
<li>m and M keybindings, and /mute and /unmute commands, for muting/unmuting entire conversations. Any notice in a muted conversation will simply not be displayed. (only on 1.0+ instances)</li>
<li>Message-splitting behaviour adjusted to make more sense with 1.0 instances.</li>
<li>"new_reply_mode" config key for not auto-prepending @usernames when starting reply mode.</li>
<li>Bugfixes for:
    <ul>
        <li>IdentiCurse gave a "bad credentials" error on trying to use valid credentials, if the Status.net instance was down.</li>
        <li>Some "currently-selected dent" commands crashed the whole program on exceptions.</li>
        <li>/link would not match ftp:// URLs.</li>
        <li>/link commands would crash IdentiCurse if no link was present in the target dent.</li>
        <li>Repeating wouldn't work on 1.0+ instances.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_7_3">
<h2>0.7.3: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Tab completion is now more reliable across different systems.</li>
<li>When deleting characters from multiline input boxes, the remaining lines are correctly moved over the line boundary.</li>
<li>"/link [notice number]" no longer causes a crash</li>
<li>Odd edge case fixed, where username/tag/group identification within a dent misidentified an entire dent as a single username/tag/group.</li>
<li>An import bug that prevented running successfully on python 2.5 is now fixed.</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_7_2">
<h2>0.7.2: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The favourites tab no longer crashes on load.</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_7_1">
<h2>0.7.1: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>No longer gets the wrong path on initial setup on Windows, which would crash it.</li>
</ul>
</a>
<a id="0_7">
<h2>0.7: <a href="#nav">&uarr;</a></h2>
</a>
<ul>
<li>New slogans.</li>
<li>The screen will now flash when an update fetches new mentions/direct messages.</li>
<li>Smoother scrolling when using a/s to switch notices; when moving to a notice that is partially/fully off the screen, IdentiCurse will now only scroll enough to make it visible, rather than scroll by an entire page. Controlled by the 'smooth_cscroll' config option, default true.</li>
<li>/quote command added, for adding/changing text when repeating a notice.</li>
<li>If HTTPS is not used when initially creating an account, IdentiCurse now double-checks that this is definitely what the user wants.</li>
<li>There is now a tab bar, which displays all tabs in order. This replaces the former "Tab x: Name" that was on the right of the status bar.</li>
<li>UI elements can now be placed in an arbitrary order, with the default layout remaining the same as the fixed layout of previous versions (except for the addition of the tab bar). See README for syntax details.</li>
<li>OAuth is now supported, and can be enabled either on initial setup, or by setting the config option 'use_oauth' to true.</li>
<li>Links for the web view of each notice can be displayed after them. Config option 'show_notice_links', default false.</li>
<li>Size of the input box can now be changed, by setting the 'length_override' config option to the minimum number of characters that should be able to fit in the input box.</li>
<li>Tab completion of usernames, groups, and tags. Determines whether to use groups/tags by looking for # or ! at the start of the word. Defaults to usernames if either @ or no sign present. Only aware of users/groups/tags already seen, unless config option 'prefill_user_cache' is set to true (this will result in all users you follow being available for tab completion, at the cost of slower startup).</li>
<li>Tab completion of commands, identified by an initial /.</li>
<li>URLs will be shortened using ur1.ca on pressing tab immediately after them (as if you were trying to tab-complete them).</li>
<li>In-development (-dev) versions now have distinct codenames from their corresponding final releases, though they share the same initial letter.</li>
<li>/quit command, has the same effect as the q keybinding.</li>
<li>'initial_tabs' now supports the favourites tab type, and also has a terser syntax for some tab types. See README for more detail.</li>
<li>"Updating" status message now also states which tab is currently being updated.</li>
<li>Reply mode: normal replying, but with the ability to edit the entire notice, rather than automatically getting the target user's name added.</li>
<li>Compact mode is now extremely compact, but disabled by default. The new non-compact is the same as 0.6's compact.</li>
<li>'show_source' option, to show/hide the source messages ("from $client") for notices. Default is true.</li>
<li>Refreshing now only fetches notices not already received, resulting in speed improvements for refreshing.</li>
<li>The cursor is now hidden when not in the input box.</li>
<li>There is now support for building on Windows.</li>
<li>The terminal's title is now set to "IdentiCurse".</li>
<li>Messages from the --colour-support command-line option are now more correct.</li>
<li>New keybindings (case sensitive: E is different to e, for example):
    <ul>
        <li>: goes into insert mode with an initial / already present. Useful for quick commands.</li>
        <li>E goes into quote mode with the currently selected notice.</li>
        <li>D goes into reply mode with the currently selected notice.</li>
        <li>, moves the current tab one place left in the tab bar.</li>
        <li>. moves the current tab one place right in the tab bar.</li>
        <li># deletes the currently selected notice.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
<li>Bugfixes for:
    <ul>
        <li>HOME/END do not work in input box.</li>
        <li>HTML entities are not expanded when encountered during remote notice expansion.</li>
        <li>All known remaining reflowing bugs.</li>
        <li>IdentiCurse crashes on very fast resizing of window.</li>
        <li>IdentiCurse crashes when certain Unicode characters are present in a notice and are not supported by the user's system.</li>
        <li>Notice time/date is displayed incorrectly when the instance has non-zero offset in its timestrings.</li>
        <li>IdentiCurse crashes on attempting to view the profile of a non-existent user.</li>
        <li>Spaces are discarded when at the start/end of lines in multi-line input box.</li>
