INSTALLATION

If you already have setuptools installed, installation is a simple
two-step process:

  1. As root, run setup.py:
     # python setup.py install

  2. Copy the example config file into your home directory as
     .identicurse:
     $ cp conf/config.json ~/.identicurse

And you're done! Read the README to get up to speed on configuring
IdentiCurse to your liking, then just run "identicurse" to get going.


If you do not have setuptools installed, you will need to either
install your distribution's package for it, or manually install it if
your distribution does not provide a package (instructions for which
will not be given here).  The package name for setuptools in various
distributions is known to be:

	python-setuptools   in	Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, openSUSE
	python2-distribute  in	Arch
	setuptools	    in	Slackware
	
	(if your distribution of choice is not in this list yet,
	feel free to inform us of the correct package name)

Once you have setuptools installed, you can proceed with the install
as above.
