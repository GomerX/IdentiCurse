INSTALLATION

Installation is a simple two-step process:

  1. As root, run setup.py:
     # pythin setup.py install

  2. Copy the example config file into your home directory as
     .identicurse:
     $ cp conf/config.json ~/.identicurse

And you're done! Read the README to get up to speed on configuring
IdentiCurse to your liking, then just run "identicurse" to get going.
