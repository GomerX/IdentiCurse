BASIC CONFIGURATION

Important note:
IdentiCurse looks for your config file in two locations. First it
checks .identicurse in your home directory, and then it checks
config.json in the current directory. It is highly recommended that
you copy the supplied config.json to $HOME/.identicurse before
modifying, as that way future updates will not erase any customisation
you have made.

Before using IdentiCurse, you must configure it with your account
login credentials. To do so, edit your config file in your favourite
editor, changing "username": "user" and "password": "test" to
appropriate values. You can also use IdentiCurse with other StatusNet
instances by changing "api_path" to the API home for the instance you
wish to use. However, this is not yet well tested, so expect
breakages.


USING IDENTICURSE

Once you've configured IdentiCurse for your account, start it by
running main.py. You will see a message, "Welcome to IdentiCurse!",
and then after a short while, IdentiCurse itself will load (this delay
is due to fetching all the initial dents). Once you are at this
screen, you can do press various keys to do the following:
    
    KEY         ACTION
    1           Switch to tab 1 (initial default: Personal Timeline).
    2           Switch to tab 2 (initial default: Mentions).
    3           Switch to tab 3 (initial default: Direct Message Inbox).
    4           Switch to tab 4 (initial default: Public Timeline).
    5           Switch to tab 5 (no initial tab).
    6           Switch to tab 6 (no initial tab).
    7           Switch to tab 7 (no initial tab).
    8           Switch to tab 8 (no initial tab).
    9           Switch to tab 9 (no initial tab).
    p           Switch to the previous tab.
    n           Switch to the next tab.
    x           Close the currently visible tab.
    r           Refresh.
    q           Quit IdentiCurse.
    h           Open a tab that displays this README.
    i           Switch to text entry mode.

You can also use the arrow keys to navigate within the current tab:
UP and DOWN scroll up and down the tab's content, and LEFT and RIGHT
move to newer and older pages, respectively, for all tabs that support
multiple pages (all timelines except public, at the time of writing).

In text entry mode, the above key shortcuts are not available.
Instead, you type a message directly into the text entry field,
and then press enter to submit. A plain message will simply be
posted as a normal dent, but you can also use various commands by
starting the message with a / (for example "/reply 1 Hello!" would
trigger the /reply command rather than post "/reply 1 Hello!"  as a
dent). Available commands are as follows:

/reply [notice number] [message]                (aliases: /r)
   This will create a reply to the notice in your current view with
   the notice number specified.

/reply [(@)username] [message]                  (aliases: /r)
   This will create a mention of the user specified. The username can
   be entered with or without a @ at the beginning, either will work.

/favourite [notice number]            (aliases: /favorite, /fav, /f)
   This will add the notice with the notice number specified to your
   favourites.

/repeat [notice number]                         (aliases: /rt)
   This will create a repeat of the notice with the notice number
   specified.

/direct [(@)username] [message]                 (aliases: /dm, /d)
   This will send a direct message to the user specified. As with
   /reply, the username will work with or without the @.

/delete [notice number]                         (aliases: /del)
   This will delete the notice with the notice number specified. It
   will only work for your notices, not those created by other users.

/profile [notice number]                        (aliases: /p)
   This will open a new tab showing the profile of the user who
   created the notice with the notice number specified.

/profile [(@)username]                          (aliases: /p)
   This will open a new tab showing the profile of the user specified.
   As with /reply and /direct, the @ is optional.

/user [notice number]                           (aliases: /u)
   This will open a new tab showing the timeline of the user who
   created the notice with the notice number specified.

   This will open a new tab showing the timeline of the user
   specified. As with /reply and /direct, the @ is optional.

/context [notice number]                        (aliases: /c)
   This will open a new tab showing the context of the notice with the
   notice number specified. You can identify notices which have
   context by the fact that their "from X" message has a [+] after it.

/subscribe [notice number]                      (aliases: /sub)
   This will subscribe you to the user who created the notice with the
   notice number specified.

/subscribe [(@)username]                        (aliases: /sub)
   This will subscribe you to the user specified.  The @ is optional.

/unsubscribe [notice number]                    (aliases: /unsub)

   This will open a new tab showing the timeline of the group
   specified.  Much like the @ in username-based commands, the ! is
   optional.

/groupjoin [(!)group]                           (aliases: /gjoin, /gj)
   This will add you as a member of the group specified.  The ! is
   optional.

/groupleave [(!)group]                          (aliases: /gleave, /gl)
   This will remove you from membership of the group specified.  The !
   is optional.

/tag [(#)tag]                                   (aliases: /t)
   This will open a new tab showing the timeline of the tag
   specified. Like the @ or ! in username-/group-based commands, the #

/public
   This will open a new tab showing the public timeline, which
   contains the 20 most recent notices from anyone on identi.ca (or
   whichever instance you are using).

/directs                                        (aliases: /inbox)
   This will open a new tab showing the direct messages other users
   have sent to you.

/sentdirects                                    (aliases: /outbox)
   This will open a new tab showing the direct messages you have sent
   to other users.

/favourites                          (aliases: /favorites, /favs, /fs)
   This will open a new tab showing the direct messages you have added
   to your favourites.

/search [query string]                          (aliases: /find, /?, /s)
   This will open a new tab showing notices that contain the query
   string specified.

/block [notice number]                          (aliases: /b)
   This will create a block against the user who created the notice
   with the notice number specified. You can also add additional
   notice numbers to block the users who created all of them.

/block [(@)username]                            (aliases: /b)
   This will create a block against of the user specified.  As usual,
   the @ is optional. You can also add additional usernames to block
   all of them.

/unblock [notice number]                        (aliases: /unb)
   This will remove a block against the user who created the notice
   with the notice number specified. You can also add additional
   notice numbers to unblock the users who created all of them.

/unblock [(@)username]                          (aliases: /unb)
   This will remove a block against of the user specified.  As usual,
   the @ is optional. You can also add additional usernames to
   unblock all of them.

/spamreport [notice number] [reason]      (aliases: /sr, /nuke)
   This will submit a spam report dent in Identi.ca support's
   preferred format and also create a block against the user who
   created the notice with the notice number specified.

/spamreport [(@)username] [reason]        (aliases: /sr, /nuke)
   This will submit a spam report dent in Identi.ca support's
   preferred format and also create a block against the user
   specified.

/config [key] [value]                           (aliases: /set)
   This will set the config item with the specified key to the
   specified value. The key can also contain .s to indicate subkeys,
   though so far only aliases require subkeys to configure.
   Since this isn't such an intuitive command, here are some simple
   examples:
        /config aliases./x /delete
        This would make /x an alias for the /delete command.

        /config username test
        This would set your logon username to "test". Note that this
        particular key is only read in on startup, so changing
        credentials this way would require a restart of IdentiCurse.

After submitting your message/command, you will be back in non-text
entry mode until you next press i. You can submit an empty text field
to leave text entry mode without performing any action.


ADVANCED CONFIGURATION

Initial tabs:
The tabs that are automatically loaded on startup can be configured by
editing the initial_tabs key. This key should contain tab names,
separated by vertical bars (|). The valid tab names are as follows:
          home             The personal timeline tab.
          mentions         The mentions tab.
          direct           The received direct messages tab.
          sentdirect       The sent direct messages tab.
          public           The public timeline tab.
          user:NAME        A user timeline tab for the user with
                           username @NAME.
          tag:TAG          A tag timeline tab for the #TAG tag.
          group:GROUP      A group timeline tab for the !GROUP group.
          help             A help tab, the same as is opened when h
                           is pressed during use.
          profile:NAME     A user profile tab for the user with
                           username @NAME.
          search:QUERY     A search tab with results from searching
                           for QUERY.
          context:ID       A context tab for the notice with id of ID.

Aliases:
In addition to the preset aliases, it is possible to add your own
custom aliases by editing the "aliases" record in your config
file. The preset aliases are stored in this way. and they are good
examples of how to correctly format an alias.  It is not recommended
that you edit this section without a basic understanding of JSON
syntax (for a good basic introduction, we recommend CouchDB's JSON
Primer: < http://guide.couchdb.org/editions/1/en/json.html >).

Long notice handling:

When IdentiCurse encounters a notice that is too long to send to the
current instance, there are three paths it can take, based on the
current value of the long_dent config key:

        1 - It simply does not send the notice, instead giving an
            error indicating how many characters the maximum length
            was exceeded by. This option is not recommended, as it
            discards the original message, which must therefore be
            rewritten from scratch. This will be chosen if long_dent
            is set to "drop".

        2 - The notice is semi-intelligently split into 2 or more
            notices of sendable length. This will be chosen if
            long_dent is set to "split".
        
        3 - The notice is truncated, stopping immediately after the
            last character that fits into the sendable length. This
            will be chosen if long_dent is set to "truncate".
